    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced fully-fermented kimchi</li>
        <li>1 to 2 scallions <em>two if thin and small</em></li>
        <li>1/4 medium onion</li>
        <li>3 ounces minced pork, canned tuna (without the liquid), or squid cut into small strips - optional</li>
        <li>cooking oil with high smoke point for pan frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Batter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour or buchimgaru (Korean pancake premix) <em>or Swap 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour with sweet rice flour or corn/potato starch</em></li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons juice/liquid from kimchi See note on water below <em>See note on water below</em></li>
        <li>1 or 2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean chili pepper paste) or gochugaru - optional</li>
        <li>1 lightly beaten egg - optional</li>
        <li>1 cup icy cold water <em>Use more water if juice/liquid from kimchi is unavailable and not using an egg. Flour to liquid should be about 1:1 ratio in total.</em></li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Optional Dipping Sauce</h3>
    <em>Combine all the Ingredients</em>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>pinch of black pepper</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Thinly slice the kimchi, about 1/2-inch thick. Cut the scallions into about 2-inch pieces. If the white part is thick, cut in half lengthwise. Thinly slice the onion.</li></p>
        <p><li>In a large bowl, combine the flour (or pancake mix) with the liquid from kimchi, the optional gochujang/gochugaru and egg, and water, a little bite at a time. Start with dissolving the gochujang with water, and mix everything together. Do not over mix.</li></p>
        <p><li>Add a little more water if the batter is too thick. The batter should flow easily from a spoon.</li></p>
        <p><li>Stir in the kimchi, scallions, onion and the optional protein of your choice.</li></p>
        <p><li>Heat one tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Ladle the mixture into the pan, and spread it evenly into a thin round shape. Cook until the edges turn light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Turn it over, and add more oil to the sides of the pan. Gently swirl the pan to distribute the oil under the pancakes. Press the pancake down with a spatula. Cook until the other side is nicely browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Repeat the process until there is no remaining batter. Serve hot with a dipping sauce, if desired.</li></p>
    </ol>
    <p>So delicious!</p>
